This is a **fully flexible** css builder based on [`React`](https://facebook.github.io/react/)

## Note

The basic infrastructure is created and currently all attributes starting with **"a", "c", "d" and "e" has been incorporated**.
You are welcome to inject more and make it "full-fledged" css-builder for **everyone**
Currently its a preview build and "0.1.0" will be the first fully fledged version to consume.

Give STAR to encourage me to complete this mammoth task with more energy
